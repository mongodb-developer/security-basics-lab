They interact with the Atlas UI, API, or CLI.Atlas Data Plane Users: These users are created within an Atlas project and are used by applications and clients to connect to and authenticate against the actual MongoDB databases hosted on Atlas. They have specific database roles and privileges. MongoDB Atlas supports multiple authentication mechanisms: SCRAM (Default): The default and simplest mechanism for MongoDB, providing secure authentication using salted challenge-response methods. (For production deployment we recommend using a more advanced authentication mechanism)X.509 Certificate Authentication: Certificate-based authentication that uses SSL/TLS certificates for verifying client identity, typically used in environments that require high security.AWS IAM Authentication:MongoDB Atlas supports AWS IAM authentication, allowing users to authenticate using their AWS Identity and Access Management roles, which is useful for integration with AWS services.Workforce Identity Federation Authentication: Allows users to integrate MongoDB Atlas with external identity providers (IdPs) like Okta or Azure AD for centralized access management and single sign-on (SSO).Workload Identity Federation Authentication: Enables authentication for applications and workloads by allowing them to assume predefined roles, simplifying access management for services running in hybrid or multi-cloud environments.LDAP Authentication: Allows integration with corporate directory services, enabling centralized management of user access across the organization. SCRAM Authentication‚Äã SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is MongoDB's default authentication mechanism. It provides secure username/password authentication.
