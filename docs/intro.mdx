# MongoDB Security Basics

Welcome to the MongoDB Security Basics guide. This comprehensive tutorial covers essential security concepts and implementations for both MongoDB Atlas and On-premises deployments.

## Overview

This guide is structured to help you understand and implement MongoDB security features effectively. Each section provides side-by-side comparisons of implementing security features in both MongoDB Atlas and On-premises environments.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Intro and Network Security
Explore Atlas-specific security features:
- Network access controls
- Private endpoints

Explore self-hosted considerations for network security

### 2. Authentication
Learn about different authentication mechanisms and how to:
- Set up user authentication
- Implement X.509 certificate authentication
- Manage credentials securely

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Understand how to:
- Create and manage roles
- Assign privileges to roles
- Implement role inheritance
- Follow security best practices for access control

### 4. Queryable Encryption

Learn how to handle your sensitive information with our most advanced encryption technique:
- Setup encrypiton keys
- Create an encrypted client
- Write and read encrypted field data


### 5. Security Considerations and Summary
Learn about additional Atlas and self-hosted security configurations:
- System hardening
- Encryption options
- Database auditing
- Backup security
- Audit logging
- Backup strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before implementing security measures, ensure you have:

1. **MongoDB Atlas Users**
   - An Atlas account
   - Access to a notebook environment to install Atlas CLI on.

   **Recommended one of:**
   - [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) , for general concepts: get yourself familiar using this  [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj). 
   - [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/getting-started-with-github-codespaces-for-machine-learning)
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) 

2. **On-Premises Users**
   - MongoDB installed
   - Administrative access
   - Basic understanding of Linux/Unix systems

## Using This Guide

Each section provides:
- Side-by-side comparisons of Atlas and On-premises implementations
- Practical code examples
- Best practices
- Security checklists
- Hands-on exercises by using `.ipynb` notebooks.

### Tab Navigation

Throughout this guide, you'll find content organized in tabs:
- **Atlas**: MongoDB Atlas specific instructions
- **On-Premises**: Self-hosted deployment instructions

This allows you to focus on the content relevant to your deployment type while understanding the differences between approaches.

## Security Best Practices

Regardless of your deployment type, always:

 1. **Network Security**
   - Restrict network access
   - Use TLS/SSL encryption
   - Implement proper firewall rules

2. **Enable Authentication**
   - Never run MongoDB without authentication
   - Use strong passwords
   - Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms

2. **Use Access Controls**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit user access
   - Implement role-based access control


4. **Use Queryable Encryption**
   - Setup queryable encryption
   - Create database encrypted client and collections
   - Read and write encrypted documents.



## Next Steps

1. Start with [Initial Setup](./setup) to get started on completing the challenge sections.
2. Progress to [Network Setup](./atlas) for authorising access and [Authentication](./authentication) for database user management and [Authorization](./rbac).
3. Explore [Queryable Encryption](./queryable-encryption) for document based security.
4. Finally, recap everything in Security Considerations and Summary.
